## What motivates this question?

How students engage with feedback and what they do next, whether it promotes positive learning behaviour, is clearly important to close the loop of assessment for learning. Yet apparently little is known about what students do when they get feedback. Do they read it and engage with it? What do they do next? If they got a question wrong, do they attempt relevant learning and reattempt the assessment item? If they get positive feedback, do they set themselves new learning goals to advance to the next level of the topic? 

## What might an answer look like?

A questionnaire asking students to report their behaviour could be used. It could be that tracking within an integrated learning and assessment system could be used to track what students do when engaging with feedback and what they do afterwards.
