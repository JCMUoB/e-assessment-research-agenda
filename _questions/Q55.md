## What motivates this question?

The question is motivated by a case of a new degree programme having all in-term summative assessment to be delivered using CAA; and observations of how staff engaged in authoring of questions, and what seems to influence (perhaps limit the scope of) their CAA content. This started with no content and within 4 years delivering CAA roughly every 2 weeks for 32 weeks of the year to around 800-900 students in 3 year groups, in a variety of topics in core mathematics, optimization, statistics and financial mathematics.  

## What might an answer look like?

Analysis of the content produced by staff would provide some insight; interviews and surveys and other traditional research methods would also likely be helpful. John Meyer says "I'm planning to write up a brief reflective piece based on the previous 4 years of my teams' experience delivering CAA (hopefully we'll get it submitted in about 3 months). I'm not convinced we will answer either of the questions below but we'll likely include some related comments (and perhaps comments related to other questions which I can't see)."
