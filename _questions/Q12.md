This question could be intrepreted in two different ways, and hence may need further clarification.

* A: When asking a multiple-response question with more than one correct option what are the relative benefits of giving students precise details of which options where right or wrong, compared to simply telling students the number of the options they selected which were right or wrong. (This could then led to the student playing a game with the computer to logically identify which are the correct options by changing their choices.)  (This option is indicated by the example given in the current question statement)

* B: When presenting results to students at the end of a quiz, in addition to giving feedback on individual questions, is it benefical to give collective feedback on subsets of the questions? For example, in an assessment on calculus, how useful is it to give separate "gradings" on the differentiation questions and the integration questions. (Which was the intrepration of at least one contributer of this question)


## What motivates this question?

When using computer assessment for diagnostic tesing (for example) it is thought to be useful to give feedback on topics (collections of related questions) in addition to that on individual questions. What is the best granularity of grouping questions for this, and what sort of feedback at this level is most helpful?

Such feedback could be at the time of answering the question, or at the end of the quiz, summarising different groupings of questions.

## What might an answer look like?

*TODO: Description of research that may be carried out to address this question - ideally including planned work by WG members!*

This may take the form of a survey of users needs? Or testing various different possibilities with students.
