We believe that practice is essential to learning mathematics. We create fomative e-assements to give students that practice. Can we find evidence that this really helps students learn?


## What motivates this question?

Answering this question may help teacher know what is the most effective way to help their students laern. I may also help justify investment into e-assessment by an institution, either in systems or in staff time to develop and maintain questions.

Many studies find a postive correlation that doing well in e-assessment correlates with other assessment methods. However, this may not reveal a causal relationship. Is it comfortable to go over things you alreedy know with the compmuter providing validation, so it is just that the more able students are more likely to engage. The finding of Hannah et al. (2014) that further practice with e-assessment was a negative predictor for exam performance is troubling, and the resulting question of whether e-assessment is just ‘busy work’, taking up time that could be used more effectively, seems to merit investigation.


## What might an answer look like?

It is extremely difficult to distinguish two scenarios:

- The formative assessments help the student learn.
- The students who already know the material are more likely to engage with the formative exercises.

a convincing answer would prove that it was the former, not the latter, but this is not easy. One approach to untangling this might be statistical modelling (e.g. Lowe & Mestel, 2020). The other approach is to actually conduct randomised controlled trials, but these can be difficult to organise.

What are we comparing formative quizzes with? Are we comparing 30 mins attempting a formative quiz to doing nothing, or 30 minutes spend on some other relevant activity?
