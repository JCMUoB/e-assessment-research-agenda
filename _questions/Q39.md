We believe that practice is essential to learning mathematics. We create fomative e-assements to give students that practice. Can we find evidence that this really helps students learn.

## What motivates this question?

That e-assessment, especially for small amount of module credit, encourages students to practice seems to be widely agreed. What is not clear is whether this is beneficial for student learning. Evidence that doing well in e-assessment correlates with other assessment methods may not reveal a causal relationship. The finding of Hannah et al. (2014) that further practice with e-assessment was a negative predictor for exam performance is troubling, and the resulting question of whether e-assessment is just ‘busy work’, taking up time that could be used more effectively, seems to merit investigation. 

*TODO: Summary of relelvant existing work, drawing on original submission and any comments from the survey*

An answer to this question might help justify investment into e-assessment by an institution, either in systems
or in staff time to develop and maintain questions.

## What might an answer look like?

*TODO: Description of research that may be carried out to address this question - ideally including planned work by WG members!*

The answer would need to be able to distinguish those those who have benifited in their learning by using the quizzes 
from those able students who will participate in all activities available to them. 

One could possibly extend the statistical modelling of student performance an engagement used with a small sample in
