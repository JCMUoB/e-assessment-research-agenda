*TODO: Expanding on the question in 2-3 sentences*

## What motivates this question?

* About ten years ago, Stockholm University changed their model of the first semester of mathematics studies. A simplified description is that the semester includes two courses, algebra and calculus, each of 15 credit points. The students must pass eight e-based tests during the semester. The tests deal with “simple standard questions”. The purpose is to force students to start working already in the beginning of the semester. An interesting question is how this model promotes learning and how it can be implemented at other universities.
* One question might be how the result at Stockholm University has improved.
* How do students feel about these tests? Positive? Stress facktors?

## What might an answer look like?

## Related questions

* Even though this is not formative assessment, the purpose is to enhance students’ learning to improve their results on the final exam. Thus, this question is connected to [Q39: How can formative e-assessments improve students’ performance in end-of-module assessments?] (Q39.md)
