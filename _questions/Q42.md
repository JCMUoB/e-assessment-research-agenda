## What motivates this question?

*TODO: Summary of relelvant existing work, drawing on original submission and any comments from the survey*

Greenhow (2008) says distractors or mal-rules are “consistent but incorrect methods” used by students when answering questions. Producing plausible distractors is difficult (Lawson, 2002), as is anticipating student errors (Walker et al., 2015). 

## What might an answer look like?

*TODO: Description of research that may be carried out to address this question - ideally including planned work by WG members!*

This should include qualitative research into the student view/experience as well as that of the teacher.
If common errors are not listed, the student making the error can assume there is a mistake in the question!
