Does the different submission medium of computer based questions and paper based questions affect students performance?

## What motivates this question?

There are two main differences between computer-based and paper-based mathematical assessments which could affect the final mark awarded to a student.
* A: The medium used to submit answers. Does the need to enter answers into a computer affect the correctness of that answer? Possible issues that could affect this include
* i) The need to enter the answer using some computer syntax or equation editor, which might lead to errors
* ii) Whether students carry out working on paper before entering their answer into a computer or not. Any lack of working may result in slips due to mental-only processing of the problem, whereas students submitting on paper may be more inclinded to produce more complete paper workings whilst solving a problem.

* B: The method used for marking. Computer marking may be more consistent than human marking, since human markers may miss small errors in one submission when marking a complete set of submissions, yet human markers are more able to use their intuition to (rightly or wrongly) award marks where the believe they know what a student meant to say, even if they did not fully express it. Automated marking is also in principle objective, fair and reliable, whereas doubts have been expressed about the consistency and quality of human markers (Foster, 2007). However, an e-assessment system should be monitored because systematic marking errors may take place (Ferrão, 2010).

## What might an answer look like?

*TODO: Description of research that may be carried out to address this question - ideally including planned work by WG members!*

Could compare the performace of balanced groups of students on online/paper tests. Ensuring the equity of the groups would be hard?
Question involving the production of diagrams might be an interesting example to use.
Do either system favour students with different accessibility needs?
