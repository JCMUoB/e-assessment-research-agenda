Success in e-assessment signals to students that they have developed the required knowledge and understanding, which may result in disengagement from further learning. However, given that e-assessment is limited, and some prefer to test procedural knowledge through e-assessment and support this with deeper learning elsewhere, might this signal be misleading students? 

## What motivates this question?

Broughton, Hernandez-Martinez and Robinson (2013) say that because students set learning goals based on achieving percentage marks in e-assessment, they do not challenge themselves to go beyond the summative assessment material. That e-assessment does not inspire students to “continue the learning cycle and explore new learning goals” means that there is a point where it is “no longer effective”. Broughton, Hernandez-Martinez and Robinson (2013) observe that a lack of conceptual understanding is only identified in the final exam, which calls into question the ability for e-assessment to act as formative development.

It is entirely plausible that an assessor would use e-assessment for some more procedural aspects of learning as a baseline on which to build deeper concepts, but that students might take success to be an indicator that they are well-prepared for future assessments on this topic (e.g. an examination). This might be a reason why some report misalignment between e-assessment test scores and examination marks, for example Greenhow (2002) observes that "repeatable-on-demand online objective tests do not appear to rank students correctly" (p. 15).

## What might an answer look like?

*TODO: Description of research that may be carried out to address this question - ideally including planned work by WG members!*

How should systems be used in order for students to be encouraged to see success in e-assessment as a driver to set new learning goals?
