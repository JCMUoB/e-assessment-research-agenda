## What motivates this question?

Much has been written about the design of mathematical tasks (see for example the 2015 ICMI Study 22 on Task Design in Mathematics Education; Mason & Johnston-Wilder, 2004; Swan, 2008), but most of the work is focused on primary and secondary school with relatively little attention paid to tasks aimed at undergraduates. Even less is known about the design of online assessment at university level. It would be useful to develop a set of design principles for online assessment. The principles could involve the mathematical type of the question (eg example-generation), the format of the question (eg multiple choice), and the type  and timing of feedback. The design principles could be used to advise practitioners.

This question interacts with various technical questions in e-assessment design. For example, Sangwin (2007) refers to “provided response questions”, in which “a student is provided with a list of potential answers and asked to make a selection, match-up, rearrange or perform various other kinds of interactions”, and says these are “almost always a constraint dictated by the software, and not the preferred choice of the user”. These can provide a hint for students who do not know how to begin a question or allow answering by a process of elimination or guessing. Some provided-response tasks may not test the desired earning outcomes. For example, an integral may be answered by differentiating the response options, applying the technique of differential calculus when integral calculus was supposed to be tested (Lawson, 2002). Parameterised questions backed by a CAS allow for questions with multiple correct answers, allowing example-generation tasks to be wrtten.

## What might an answer look like?

A group of task designers could work together to develop design principles or to adapt previous design frameworks. The opportunities and constraints inherent in the use of online assessment at undergraduate level would be taken into consideration.
