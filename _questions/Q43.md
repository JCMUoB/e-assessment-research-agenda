*TODO: Expanding on the question in 2-3 sentences*

## What motivates this question?

Much has been written about the design of mathematical tasks (see for example the 2015 ICMI Study 22 on Task Design in Mathematics Education; Mason & Johnston-Wilder, 2004; Swan, 2008), but most of the work is focused on primary and secondary school with relatively little attention paid to tasks aimed at undergraduates. Even less is known about the design of online assessment at university level. It would be useful to develop a set of design principles for online assessment. The principles could involve the mathematical type of the question (eg example-generation), the format of the question (eg multiple choice), and the type  and timing of feedback. The design principles could be used to advise practitioners.


## What might an answer look like?

A group of task designers could work together to develop design principles or to adapt previous design frameworks. The opportunities and constraints inherent in the use of online assessment at undergraduate level would be taken into consideration.
