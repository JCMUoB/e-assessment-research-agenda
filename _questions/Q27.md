## What motivates this question?
This question is directed towards the computer marking of assessment, rather than the computer mediated submission of an assessment for human marking. 

Writing mathematics on a piece of paper, a student has a great deal of freedom in how they proceed. On an e-assessment system, however, this production of mathematics is constrained either by the linear format of typed mathematics, or by the sequencing of questions. Giving students freedom similar to writing on a piece of paper would make marking difficult, although Harjula (2017) talks about a “free-path question type” which allows the student the freedom of writing on a piece of paper. 

## What might an answer look like?
The answer might involve a review of paper-based assessments, and investigations as to how best these could be replicated within a computer assessment system. It should also involve trials of the questions with students and an analysis of their feedback on their experience.
