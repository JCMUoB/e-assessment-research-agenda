Instant feedback is sometimes presented as a considerable advantage of e-assessment, though the level and quality of feedback produced is sometimes in doubt, leading to questions about the effectiveness of such feedback to promote learning.

## What motivates this question?

E-assessment enables instant feedback on student work. Feedback on a mistake at the time the student made the mistake is potentially effective because the mistake is corrected while the student is thinking about the work, rather than potentially weeks later as in the case of human marking. Such feedback can present a correct solution to the randomised problem the student encountered. However, some question whether automated feedback helps learning especially for weaker students, because this may present to students as simply another worked example like those found in taught material which students may struggle to interpret (Broughton et al., 2017; Robinson et al., 2012). 

Rønning (2017) reports students preferring to receive richer feedback from human-marked work and taking greater care when writing mathematics which will be examined by a person, learning more from the process of presenting their argument to an assumed reader than they would through automated marking.
