## What motivates this question?

Proof lies at the heart of mathematics, and is a hallmark which distinguises mathematics from other subjects.
So, from the perspective of assessment which is authentic to the discipline, it is natural to seek to assess proof.

Mathematical proof may (or may not) be more constrained and structured language than other subject areas. Whereas automatic assessment of the content of an essay seems hopeless, a mathematical proof may be constrained enough to make progress.

Bickerton and Sangwin made some practical proposals, (untested) in the reference below. http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01581
These might be investigated with more specific research questions.

## What might an answer look like?

Research in this direction might focus on convergent validity, considering established metrics for students' understanding of proof as benchmark metrics against which to compare innovated automated assessments. This could include traditional written assessments, multiple-choice comprehension quizzes (e.g. Mejia-Ramos et al. 2017), proof summaries (Davies et al., 2020) or validation tasks [insert citation]. A study to this end is in development in 2021, with the intention to collect relevant data in 2022 at The University of Edinburgh and University College London. 

Another approach to this question, related to Q43 and Q51, might focus on design principles for writing automated assessment questions in this area. Researchers might draw on the Design-based Research methodology to iteratively develop theoretical principles and practical artefacts in a cyclic process. Ruth Reynolds and Ben Davies (University College London) have proposed a workshop to this end at the 4th International STACK Conference hosted by TTK University of Applied Sciences in April 2021.
