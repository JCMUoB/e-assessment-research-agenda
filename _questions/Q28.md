## What motivates this question?

Proof lies at the heart of mathematics, and is a hallmark which distinguises mathematics from other subjects.
So, from the perspective of assessment which is authentic to the discipline, it is natural to seek to assess proof.

Mathematical proof may (or may not) be more constrained and structured language than other subject areas. Whereas automatic assessment of the content of an essay seems hopeless, a mathematical proof may be constrained enough to make progress.

Bickerton and Sangwin made some practical proposals, (untested) in the reference below. http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01581
These might be investigated with more specific research questions.

## What might an answer look like?
