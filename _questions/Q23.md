*TODO: Expanding on the question in 2-3 sentences*

## What motivates this question?

Comparative judgement has been proposed and studies as a learning activity for mathematics, and in particular conceptual learning, but there is no systematic evidence as to whether and what learning takes place.

## What might an answer look like?

This is a causal question requiring a teaching experiment with pre- and post-tests. If that is not viable then perhaps at least qualitative evidence of students' improved tests, and interviews with lecturers.
