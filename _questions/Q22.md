Some express doubts that e-assessment is reliable in this way, and many use e-assessment for quite low-stakes assessment as a result. 

## What motivates this question?

Writing reliable and valid questions for e-assessment is a difficult task requiring specific expertise. Additionally, there are limitations to the e-assessment format, potentially greater focus on procedural elements, etc. The examination is seen as the 'gold standard' for mathematics undergraduate assessment, so it may be useful to investigate whether performance in one correlates with performance in the other. 

Broughton et al. (2017) report lecturers believing their e-assessment system was “unreliable as a measure of student performance, knowledge and understanding” and that they “could not rely on the marks that the system offered”. Greenhow (2002) observes that "repeatable-on-demand online objective tests do not appear to rank students correctly" (p. 15). 

## What might an answer look like?

A study comparing e-assessment marks or rankings with marks or rankings in other assessment methods (on comparable topics) would be useful here. If these only correlate sometimes, this raises difficult questions about which is providing the more accurate measure of mathematical understanding. Say we assume exams are a good tool for assessment and find that e-assessment sometimes doesn't correlate well with this. Can we then establish in what circumstances taking formal marks from e-assessment is appropriate?
