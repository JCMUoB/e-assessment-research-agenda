Some express doubts that e-assessment is reliable in this way, and many use e-assessment for quite low-stakes assessment as a result. 

## What motivates this question?

Greenhow (2002) observes that "repeatable-on-demand online objective tests do not appear to rank students correctly" (p. 15). 

## What might an answer look like?

A study comparing e-assessment marks or rankings with marks or rankings in other assessment methods (on comparable topics) would be useful here. If these only correlate sometimes, this raises difficult questions about which is providing the more accurate measure of mathematical understanding. Say we assume exams are a good tool for assessment and find that e-assessment sometimes doesn't correlate well with this. Can we then establish in what circumstances taking formal marks from e-assessment is appropriate?
