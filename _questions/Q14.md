## What motivates this question?

The aim is to check that, for example, dyslexic students are not disadvantaged from being assessed electronically. There is some anecdotal evidence that this may be the case, perhaps due to the added difficulty of accurately copying an answer from paper to the e-assessment system.


## What might an answer look like?

Rather than specific conditions such as dyslexia, the research should perhaps focus on more general "impairments of cognitive function (attention, memory, etc.)" (Cinquin et al., 2019).

Historical data could help to address the question.
This would require details of students' e-assessment attempts, as well as being able to cross-reference whether students have reasonable adjustments for exams (usually taking the form of extra time allowed).
The question could then be addressed by checking whether there is a significant difference between how this group of students have done in e-assessment (both in uncontrolled and controlled conditions) compared to other types of assessments.

Another approach would be to use direct observation of students using an e-assessment system in a lab setting.
