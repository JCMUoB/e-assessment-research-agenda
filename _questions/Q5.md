*TODO: Expanding on the question in 2-3 sentences*
Common errors may be due to
- Errors of input: students used the wrong syntax
- Errors of intepreration: students answered the wrong question
- Mathematical errors made when answering the question

## What motivates this question?

*TODO: Summary of relelvant existing work, drawing on original submission and any comments from the survey*
Many users of eassessment systems have banks of students responses and we should use this to both improve the
systems used and provide better feedback to students on common errors.

## What might an answer look like?

*TODO: Description of research that may be carried out to address this question - ideally including planned work by WG members!*

Some initial errors of input may be detected before an answer is submitted, and hence not appear in databanks. Student questionairres/interviews
may be needed to better understand difficulties that occur.

It may be difficult to tell whether a wrong student answer is due to misinterpretation of the question or misscalcualtion. 
It would be interesting to identify those errrors that persist across different variants of the same question.
