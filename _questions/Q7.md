## What motivates this question?

To make a computer to give constructive feedback to answers, and maybe to solutions, is a complex process. How can that be handled, and what difficulties will appear? This model might be relevant at the University of Adger already in the autumn 2020, in the engineering education at campus Grimstad.

Stepping back, we should consider intrinsic or implicit feedback vs external or explicit feedback. For example, consider the difference between a message popping up to say an answer is right or wrong, vs a GeoGebra construction where a student 'discovers' an inherent flaw in their work. 


## What might an answer look like?

Drawing on school-based research in which feedback is inherent [example](https://doi.org/10.5951/jresematheduc.43.1.0002) and game-based learning research [example](https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2019.00118) may help with this. Contributor Ian Jones will be supervising a project looking at the primary arithmetic app [Stick and Split](https://www.stickandsplit.com) which, not HE or assessment (sorry!), but will involve considering the role of implicit feedback.
