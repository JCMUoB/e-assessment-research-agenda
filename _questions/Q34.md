## What motivates this question?

Martin and Greenhow (2004) say repeated practice on similar questions with study of resulting feedback allows students to develop deep understanding, by learning what underlies a question type. However, Rønning (2017) says students experiment by trying out different variations on their input when it is marked incorrect, suggesting this does not encourage deep learning. Can experimenting with input in an e-assessment system develop conceptual understanding, and, if so, how? It is claimed by some that immediate feedback decreases students’ independence, need to check their own answers and control of their learning. How do we avoid immediate feedback producing dependency among students when we are trying to develop independent learners?
