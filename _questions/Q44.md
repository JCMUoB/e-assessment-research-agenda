## What motivates this question?

*TODO: Summary of relelvant existing work, drawing on original submission and any comments from the survey*

Anne Watson and John Mason, in their classic text:

Watson, A., & Mason, J. (2006). Mathematics as a constructive activity: Learners generating examples. Routledge.

build on Michener's notion of 'example spaces' and highlight students' mathematical development in terms of (i) expanding the range of examples students are aware of within a particular mathematical area, and (ii) enriching the knowledge of those examples. This is often done by presenting students with new examples that they need to be aware of, such as classic examples (e.g. modulus function as a continuous but not differentiable function) but could also be done by asking students to play around and come up with examples that satisfy certain constraints. In some cases it may be the process of finding these examples that is of more value than the specific examples found. One difficulty in the lecture room is checking that students' examples are actually mathematically correct, and do not in fact indicate mistakes and misunderstandings. CAA such as STACK would be ideal for checking that constraints on examples are satisfied, and, if not, perhaps saying "One or more constraints are not satisfied" so as to avoid making it too easy for the student and forcing them to go back and check carefully.

In school-level mathematics, there are many example-generation task types used, many of which might be considerably enhanced with CAA. For example, Venn diagrams are a convenient way to set up problems of separate and overlapping constraints, where the student is required (if possible) to provide an example for each region, or (if not) explain why it is impossible. Could this be set up in CAA?


## What might an answer look like?

*TODO: Description of research that may be carried out to address this question - ideally including planned work by WG members!*

Evidence of implentablity within CAA would be lecturers able to set up these problems and students able to access them and make use of them.
Choices would have to be made about the kind of feedback provided (see above).
Pre- and post- tests of 'richness of example space' might provided evidence of effectiveness, as compared with paper and pencil tasks in a comparison condition.
Individualised, immediate feedback could be beneficial, or perhaps not. In even a moderately-sized lecture, the lecturer will not have time to go round and evaluate each student's examples carefully, whereas CAA could, so there is a potential route to greater effectiveness here.
