## What motivates this question?

The expansion of e-assessment in mathematics will require the input of an increased number of teaching staff. It is important to understand the needs of individuals who are new to e-assessment to provide the necessary support and training to enable them to succeed in adopting e-assessment. For example, mastery of the hardware/input interface might be required before an individual considers the pedagogical cost/benefit of mode of student entry

This question may contribute to moving e-assessment beyond innovator-enthusiasts to more mainstream practice. Barton, Foster, Levesley and McCabe (2012) visited seven universities in the north-east of England and found use of e-assessment in mathematics there “largely dependent upon local enthusiasts” and “generally declining” over ten years to 2011. However, Broughton, Robinson and Hernandez-Martinez (2013) report “continuing established practice” and “department influence” to be reasons to use e-assessment for lecturers who take over teaching a module where e-assessment is used. 

## What might an answer look like?

There may exist in the literature analagous hierarcies of needs for professionals upskilling or updating their practice.

We could start by breaking down the steps/skills/equipment/expertise required construct a good e-assessment item. These items could than be pooled and a subset be selected to form a survey where we ask educators with varying expertise in e-assessment to rank the order which mastery is required in order to develop mastery with e-assessment. The notion of "mastery" could be further if we wanted. For example to: "those who have to administer e-assessment" or "those who have to create/design e-assessment". 

It may be worth investigating the practice of some groups in running workshops for new staff on e-assessment (e.g. Lawson-Perfect, 2021; STACK Project, 2021), perhaps by interviews or a survey of the people running these. What do the people running these workshops typically include in them? Are these workshops successful in training new e-assessment users who continue to use e-assessment long-term?
