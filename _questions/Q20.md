## What motivates this question?

*TODO: Summary of relelvant existing work, drawing on original submission and any comments from the survey*

The expansion of e-assessment in mathematics will require the input of an increased number of teaching staff. It is important to understand the needs of individuals who are new to e-assessment to provide the necessary support and training to enable them to succeed in adopting e-assessment. For example, mastery of the hardware/input interface might be required before an individual considers the pedagogical cost/benefit of mode of student entry

## What might an answer look like?

*TODO: Description of research that may be carried out to address this question - ideally including planned work by WG members!*

We could start by breaking down the steps/skills/equipment/expertise required construct a good e-assessment item. These items could than be pooled and a subset be selected to form a survey where we ask educators with varying expertise in e-assessment to rank the order which mastery is required in order to develop mastery with e-assessment. The notion of "mastery" could be further if we wanted. For example to: "those who have to administer e-assessment" or "those who have to create/design e-assessment".
