*TODO: Expanding on the question in 2-3 sentences*

## What motivates this question?

*TODO: Summary of relelvant existing work, drawing on original submission and any comments from the survey*

Many instititions have moved to home/remote exams due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and some may (for some courses) wish to
continue with such assessments longer term. How can e-assessment help to deliver appropriate assessments and overcome some of the
difficulties remote exams bring?  What are the advantages and disadvantages? What to students think of these assessments?

## What might an answer look like?

*TODO: Description of research that may be carried out to address this question - ideally including planned work by WG members!*

Research could consider various ways in which e-assessment might form all or part of a remote exam. What elements can be automatically marked
and which elements might need solutions uploaded for human marking. Would randomisation of CAA questions sufficiently address concerns of
plagarism. Is the performance of students affected by taking such an exam?
