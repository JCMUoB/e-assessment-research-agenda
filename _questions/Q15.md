## What motivates this question?

*TODO: Summary of relelvant existing work, drawing on original submission and any comments from the survey*

Many instititions have moved to home/remote exams due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and some may (for some courses) wish to
continue with such assessments longer term. How can e-assessment help to deliver appropriate assessments and overcome some of the
difficulties remote exams bring?  What are the advantages and disadvantages? What to students think of these assessments?

Some assessors feel summative e-assessments need to be invigilated even though randomisation may offer the opportunity for e-assessments to be taken uninvigilated (Pollock, 2002; Broughton, Robinson & Hernandez-Martinez, 2013, 2017; Brouwer et al., 2017), including that e-assessment does not address impersonation and collusion. Rønning (2017) says that “the variations in the problems from one student to another are such that it is possible to produce a general solution that can be copied”, and that “it can be seen that this happens to a rather large extent”.

## What might an answer look like?

*TODO: Description of research that may be carried out to address this question - ideally including planned work by WG members!*

Research could consider various ways in which e-assessment might form all or part of a remote exam. What elements can be automatically marked
and which elements might need solutions uploaded for human marking. Would randomisation of CAA questions sufficiently address concerns of
plagarism. Is the performance of students affected by taking such an exam?
