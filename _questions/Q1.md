Does answering questions through the medium of a computer-based assigment (with the consequential need to input answers using some form of computer syntax or mathematics editor) mean students make different errors to those made on paper. Are there more, or different types of, transcription error. Can computer based assessments detect errors and misconceptiuons that are not possible to detect in paper based written answers.

## What motivates this question?

An answer to this question might help aliviate the fears of colleagues relcutant to engage with computer based assessment. It might also help identify errors or misconceptions that are hard to detect on paper. (For example, the student who thought the notation for natural logarithm was "In" (captial-eye,  en) as they had always misread ln. This would be hard to dected on paper, but on a computer causes answers to be marked as wrong.)

## What might an answer look like?

A study to answer this question might split a group of students: half doing an assessment on paper and half on computer and compare errors made. A large sample would be needed, ideally of students likely to make a significant numnber of errors. This might be informed by the answer to [Q5](Q5) which could first identify common errors in computer assessments to guide this study. A prelimnary study to idenitfy common erros made on paper might also be needed.

* See [Q5](Q5) for fleshing out of a similar question by a group at the conference 27.01.21.  This question probably follows Q5:  One needs to separately identify errors made in online and paper submissions (separately) before comparing the two,
