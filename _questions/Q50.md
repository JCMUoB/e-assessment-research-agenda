Note to help whoever is interested in this: I've lost track of this topic, but last time I was aware of it there was work on mobile interfaces similar to those used in non-Latin alphabet languages, and other systems. I believe handwriting recognition has come a long way (see e.g. Mathpix, photomath, etc.), what about speech?
