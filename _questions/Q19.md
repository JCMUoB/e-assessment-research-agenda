## What motivates this question?

E-assessment has considerable advantages, around efficiency and effectiveness of assessment. It also has limitations, including user input and automated marking. Finally, there are grey issues - areas that it is not certain whether they are purely advantages, limitations, or a combination. For example, the issue of whether instant feedback at the point of submission encourages positive learning behaviour appears to be open. The advantages and limitations vary in formative and summative circumstances, for example formative work doesn't suffer issues around impersonation or guessing. The advantages and limitations also interact with broader assessment practice, for example using e-assessment for procedural elements of assessment and reserving the more resource-intensive human-marking for more conceptual elements may be a suitable approach to avoid disadvantages around e-assessment encouraging procedural learning. Given this balance of advantages and limitations, and the changes in different circumstances, what are suitable roles for e-assessment? 

## What might an answer look like?

Perhaps a comprehensive survey of assessment practice integrating deeply the purposes and design of whole-module assessment approaches could be undertaken and analysed to draw broad conclusions about these issues.
