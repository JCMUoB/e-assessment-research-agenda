Many computer based assessment systems permit the parametrisation of questions, and hence the ability to present several variants of each question. Are such variants of value to students?

## What motivates this question?

*TODO: Summary of relelvant existing work, drawing on original submission and any comments from the survey*

Randomised/parametrised e-assessment items introduces additional complexities with increased chances of errors/bugs/boundary cases. While parametrisation could potentially address the issue of plagiarism, it is unclear whether this increase in complexity improves student learning/mastery of the content. For example, students may only see a single instance of a parametrised problem. A negligible effect in parametrised problems could significantly reduce the work in designing e-assessment items and allow for new modes of new assessment. 

Rather than parametrised questions (those with randomised parameters), an alternative is random selection (questions selected from a question bank). This is often seen as less sophisticated, because fewer question variants are typically produced; however, it is possible that a selection of one question from ten in a question bank offers sufficient advantages while also allowing greater quality control. 

On the other hand, the availability of randomised question variants allows students to practice the type of question as often as they feel necessary.

Institutional policies may have an influence here. Some institutions only permit the reuse of e-assessment questions from year to year if they are parameterised with sufficient variants. In which case a longer term saving of staff time may result from the increased effort of producing randomised questions.

Parametrised questions can avoid a “bad learning behaviour in which students just learn the correct answers by syntax” (Schwinning et al., 2015). 

One further advantage of randomised parameters is that they need not be purely mathematical in nature, the use of randomised words can allow one question to be set in different scenarios (Greenhow, 2015). 

## What might an answer look like?

*TODO: Description of research that may be carried out to address this question - ideally including planned work by WG members!*

The answer might include an comparison between students who do such repeated e-assessment questions to those doing repetitive questions in printed exercise.
It should include student survey questions to investigate whether students perceive this to be an advantage. 
Quantitative work could be undertaken looking at banks of student responses and considering how many times different instances of the same question were answered by students, and whether that has an effect on the students final module result.

An instance of a subject multiple e-Assessment homeworks could include both randomised and non-randomised assessments. We could then look at results over the assignments (to assess mastery) and perhaps include surveys to poll students on whether they thought the items were randomised or not, as well as whether they thought it was beneficial?
