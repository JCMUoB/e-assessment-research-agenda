*TODO: Expanding on the question in 2-3 sentences*

## What motivates this question?

*TODO: Summary of relelvant existing work, drawing on original submission and any comments from the survey*

Randomised/parametrised e-assessment items introduces additional complexities with increased chances of errors/bugs/boundary cases. While parametrisation could potentially address the issue of plagarism, it is unclear whether this increase in complexity improves student learning/mastery of the content. For example, students may only see a single instance of a parametrised problem. A neglible effect in parametrised problems could significantly reduce the word in designing e-assessment items and allow for new modes of new assessment.

## What might an answer look like?

*TODO: Description of research that may be carried out to address this question - ideally including planned work by WG members!*

The answer might include an comparison between students who do such repeated e-assessment questions to those doing repeatative questions in printed exercise.
It should include student survey questions to investigate whether students perceive this to be an avantage. 
Quantitive work could be undertaken looking at banks of student responses and considering how many times different instances of the same question wee answered by students, and whether that has an effect on the students final module result.

An instance of a subject multiple e-Assessment homeworks could include both randomised and non-randomised assessments. We could then look at results over the assignments (to assess mastery) and perhaps include surveys to poll students on whether they thought the items were randomised or not, as well as whether they thought it was beneficial?
