This question does not specifically refer to automated assessments, so the answer is likely to depend on whether we talk about automated assessment or electronic hand-in of traditional assessment. What do students think they need to do to succeed with automated assessments? How does this compare to 'other' assessments which may they also be being asked to complete (traditional written assessments for example)?

## What motivates this question?

* Rønning finds evidence to suggest that students feel that the answer to an e-assessment problem is the most important part of the exercise, does this negatively affect their view on e-assessment and if so in what ways can we address these concerns?

* Studies have been carried out on the attitudes of mathematics undergraduates to assessment (for example Iannone &Simpson, 2015 and 2016). It has been found that these undergraduates value traditional assessments. It would be useful to study the attitudes of mathematics students to various types and features of online assessments. 

## What might an answer look like?

One possibility might be to use surveys and interviews to study the attitudes of students from a range of universities to a range of assessments.
