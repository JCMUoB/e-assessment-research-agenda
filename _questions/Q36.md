This question does not specifically refer to automated assessments, so the answer is likely to depend on whether we talk about automated assessment or electronic hand-in of traditional assessment. What do students think they need to do to succeed with automated assessments? How does this compare to 'other' assessments which may they also be being asked to complete (traditional written assessments for example)?

## What motivates this question?

* Rønning finds evidence to suggest that students feel that the answer to an e-assessment problem is the most important part of the exercise, does this negatively affect their view on e-assessment and if so in what ways can we address these concerns?

## What might an answer look like?
