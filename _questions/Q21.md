## What motivates this question?

Peer assessment (Topping, 2009) can be attractive to (i) engage students with assessment, (ii) promote learning through students viewing one anothers' work, (iii) promote learning through discussion about what constitutes high quality work, (iv) reduce workload on the lecturer in summative assessment contexts. There has been much work on peer assessment in higher education, and this field increasingly involves technology to support peer assessment, e.g. Ashenafi (2017). The focus here of course is on specifically mathematics.

e-assessment can hinder the potential for peer assessment activities (e.g. not obvious how STACK and such systems would be used in this way) or enhance/enable peer assessment activities (e.g. comparative judgement lends itself to peer assessment).

## What might an answer look like?

Evaluated models of peer assessment (e.g. Jones & Alcock, 2014) and reviews of the literature (e.g. ).
