I am Assitant Professor of Teaching in the Mathematics department and Durham University, and for the last two to three years have helped implement automated electronic assessments as a formative component of our assessment in our Undergraduate programmes. During this time I've written questions (primarily in STACK) for a variety of modules and helped others in the department learn how to use STACK to write questions for their own courses. I'm particularly interested in the efficacy of automated formative assessments as compared to more traditional assessment methods.
