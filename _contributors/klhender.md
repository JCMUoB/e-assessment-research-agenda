I have worked at UWE Bristol since 1995 holding the roles of Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Associate Head of Department (Cluster Lead for Mathematics) and am currently an Associate Professor in Technology Enhanced Learning.  I have promoted and enhanced the student learning experience in two significant ways; firstly by working with Dewis, the in-house algorithmic e-Assessment system developed by Dr Rhys Gwynllyw, to create assessment and learning resources in key STEM fields and secondly by, in collaboration with Dr Tim Swift, estabishing the successful espressoMaths service.  I am currently an Associate Professor (in Technology Enhanced Learning), University Learning and Teaching Fellow and an HEA National Teaching Fellow.
