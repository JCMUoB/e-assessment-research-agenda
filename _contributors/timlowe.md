I am currently the Director of Teaching in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the UK Open University. My background is as an applied mathematician, but 
more recently I have been interested in the use of computer-based systems to support and enhance the learning of mathematics. I have led the adoption of
STACK within the OU, and have written and maintain questions for several modules.
