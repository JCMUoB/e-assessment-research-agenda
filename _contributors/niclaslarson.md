Currently, I have some experience with comparative judgement in No More Marking. In January 2021, I will join a project aiming to develop the use of computer assessed tasks (e.g. in STACK) for the engineering programme at the University of Agder. This project will be financed by MatRIC, which is the Centre for Research, Innovation and Coordination of Mathematics Teaching.
