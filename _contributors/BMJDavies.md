My research interests lie in undergraduate mathematics education, focused primarily on the assessment of proof and argumentation. I am
interested in novel assessment approaches at the tertiary level, and in the automation of proof comprehension assessment in particular. I am
also a leader in STACK development in the Mathematics Department at University College London (UCL).
