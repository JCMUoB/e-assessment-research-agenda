# Scope
The scope of possible research questions is broad, but has limits. In particular, questions should directly relate to computer-aided assessment of university mathematics:

* **Computer-aided** – relying on technology in a fundamental way;
* **Assessment** – concerning formative or summative assessment, rather than teaching or learning tools (though of course the line between these and formative assessment is blurry);
* **Of university mathematics** – based on topics or task-types which are relevant to mathematics as studied university.
