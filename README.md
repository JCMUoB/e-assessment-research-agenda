# CAA Research Agenda - Contributor Guide

This repository gives us a way to collaborate on writing about the set of research questions. All the changes are tracked, so you don't need to worry about accidentally breaking things, we can always roll back!

The repository is currently private, but after we meet in January 2021 we will eventually make it public.

The files are used to generate a website, that will make it easier to browse the questions. You can see a mockup of the eventual output here: https://georgekinnear.github.io/caa-agenda-testing/

As a contributor, you should:

1. make sure you are happy with your profile,
2. add yourself as a contributor on any questions you are interested in,
3. edit the pages of those questions, to add/amend details.

## Edit your profile

Each contributor will have a profile page that will look something like this: https://georgekinnear.github.io/caa-agenda-testing/contributors/georgekinnear.html

To edit your details:

1. Click on the `_contributors' folder above.
2. Find the file with your GitHub username as its filename, e.g. `georgekinnear.md`, and click on it.
3. Click on the pencil icon at the top right: <svg class="octicon octicon-pencil" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" aria-hidden="true"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M11.013 1.427a1.75 1.75 0 012.474 0l1.086 1.086a1.75 1.75 0 010 2.474l-8.61 8.61c-.21.21-.47.364-.756.445l-3.251.93a.75.75 0 01-.927-.928l.929-3.25a1.75 1.75 0 01.445-.758l8.61-8.61zm1.414 1.06a.25.25 0 00-.354 0L10.811 3.75l1.439 1.44 1.263-1.263a.25.25 0 000-.354l-1.086-1.086zM11.189 6.25L9.75 4.81l-6.286 6.287a.25.25 0 00-.064.108l-.558 1.953 1.953-.558a.249.249 0 00.108-.064l6.286-6.286z"></path></svg>
