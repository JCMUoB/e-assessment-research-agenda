<p>Does the different submission medium of computer based questions and paper based questions affect students performance?</p>

<h2 id="what-motivates-this-question">What motivates this question?</h2>

<p>Previous research has found systematic differences in performance between paper-based and online versions of the same test (Backes and Cowan, 2019).</p>

<p>There are two main differences between computer-based and paper-based mathematical assessments which could affect the final mark awarded to a student.</p>

<h3 id="1-the-medium-used-to-submit-answers">1. The medium used to submit answers.</h3>
<p>Does the need to enter answers into a computer affect the correctness of that answer?</p>

<p>Possible issues that could affect this include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The need to enter the answer using some computer syntax or equation editor, which might lead to errors (Sangwin &amp; Ramsden, 2007)</li>
  <li>Whether students carry out working on paper before entering their answer into a computer or not. Any lack of working may result in slips due to mental-only processing of the problem, whereas students submitting on paper may be more inclinded to produce more complete paper workings whilst solving a problem.</li>
  <li>Opportunities to separate out the process of decision making, e.g expand out this term, from the ability to perform some calculation accurately.</li>
</ol>

<p>For work carried out on paper, handwriting is a relevant factor. The early studies by James (1927) and Markham (1976) found that quality of handwriting significantly influenced grades given to essays. 
Many researchers have consistently studied the association of poor handwriting with lower marks from graders (e.g., Chase, 1986; Markham, 1976; Chase, 1968; Soloff, 1973).</p>

<h3 id="2-the-method-used-for-marking">2. The method used for marking.</h3>
<p>Computer marking may be more consistent than human marking, since human markers may miss small errors in one submission when marking a complete set of submissions, yet human markers are more able to use their intuition to (rightly or wrongly) award marks where the believe they know what a student meant to say, even if they did not fully express it. Automated marking is also in principle objective, fair and reliable, whereas doubts have been expressed about the consistency and quality of human markers (Foster, 2007). However, an e-assessment system should be monitored because systematic marking errors may take place (Ferrão, 2010).</p>

<h2 id="what-might-an-answer-look-like">What might an answer look like?</h2>

<p>An experiment could investigate the effect of the medium on the students’ answers. 
For instance, students could be divided into “writing” and “typing online” groups and asked to solve the same problems. This would enable comparison of the performance between the two groups, both in terms of the correctness of the answers, and the features (such as length and quality of argument) of the answers.</p>

<h2 id="related-questions">Related questions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>This question is intimately related to:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="Q47">Q47: How can we automate the assessment of mathematical work traditionally done using paper and pen?</a> and</li>
      <li><a href="Q27">Q27: How can we assess open-ended mathematical tasks using e-assessment?</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Differences in performance could be due to a number of related factors beyond simply “paper versus computer”:
    <ul>
      <li>the approach used to mark the students’ work, related to <a href="Q17">Q17: How can we emulate human marking of students’ mathematical working such as follow-on marking and partially correct marking</a></li>
      <li>different types of errors students may make, as in <a href="Q1">Q1: Do the errors students make in e-assessments differ from those they make in paper-based assessments?</a></li>
      <li>the input mechanisms available in the e-assessment system, as in <a href="Q50">Q50: What methods are available for student input of mathematics?</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
